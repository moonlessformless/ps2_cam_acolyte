You'll find here bindings for different popular programming languages.

Please note that currently only the C and Python bindings are full bindings, while the rest
are partial bindings. This is because all of the other bindings rely on the C
library and I do not want to rewrite those per-language bindings for every change I make.

Rest assured though, it shouldn't take you more than 2 minutes of copy paste
to get started :)
